# Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2018

>If you got started with Machine Learning or Deep Learning and searched on the Internet to find what the best courses are for learning these technologies, then you must have surely come across [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/). If that's not the case, then no matter what level of expertise you possess in ML/DL, this is one course you should not miss taking(atleast once)..

This repository will be my journal for the on-going Deep Learning course which I am part of as an International Fellow. This is where I put together all my learnings, code, things I come across from the forum(fast.ai has the best forum for DL discussions) and anything I feel worth taking a note of.
